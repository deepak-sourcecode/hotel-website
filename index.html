          <p>
            The very first Hilton hotel came into being in 1919, when Conrad
            purchased the 40-room Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas. In the years
            that followed, he expanded the Hilton portfolio throughout Texas,
            opening new hotels in Dallas, Abilene, Waco and El Paso. As an
            interesting side note, the Waco Hilton was the first hotel to have
            cold running water and air conditioning. In 1949, Hilton became the
            world’s first international hotel chain with the opening of the
            Caribe Hilton Hotel in Puerto Rico. The group hit big when they
            opened San Francisco Airport Hilton in 1959 - the first of its kind.
            This had a domino effect around the world, once Hilton’s competitors
            realised how lucrative the airport accommodation market could be. In
            1973, the group implemented a central reservations system that meant
            customers could book hotel rooms from one place, rather than calling
            up the hotels individually. Today, 1.6 million people book rooms and
            spa days at Hilton hotels every month, using apps, websites and even
            chatbots. In 1987, the Hilton Honors Program was established.
            Everytime guests use a Hilton hotel or shop, eat, or travel using a
            partner’s services, they receive points, which can then be used to
            get accommodation for free.
